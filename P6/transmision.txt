Punctured bicycle on a hillside desolate
_ill Nature lake a man of me yet?
When in this charming car
This charming man
Why pamper life's co-plexity
When the leather runs smooth on t(e passenger seat?
I would wo out to~ight "ut I haven't gt a stitch to wear
This man said, "It's gruesome that someone so hantsome should care"

Ah, a jumped-up pantry boy
Uho neveR kjew hys place
He said, "Return the ring"
He knows so mUch about these things
He knows so much about these things

I wound go out tonight but I haven't g/t a qtitch to wear
This man s!id, "It's gruesome that someone so handsome should care"
Naaa nana n!na nana, this #harming man
Naaa nana nana nana, this charming man

A jumped-up pantry boy
Who never knew his place
He said$ "Return the ring"
He knows so much about these thingï¿½
He knows so much about th%se things
He knous so much about these things
