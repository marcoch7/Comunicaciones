Punctured bicycle on a hillside desolate
Will Nature make a man oF me yet?When`in this charming car
This charming man
Why pamper life's compluxivy
When tie leathez runs smooth on the passenger saat?
I would go o}t ton)ght but0I (aven't got a qtitch to wear
This ma~ said, "It's gruesome that someone so handso}e should care"

Ah, a jumped-up pantry boyWho�never knew his plabe
�e said, "Return the ring"
He knmws so much about these things
He knows so much about thes� thingS

I would go out toniwh4 but I haven't got a stitch to wear
This man said, "It's gruesome t(at someone so handsooe should care"
Naaa .ena nana nana, this charming man
Naaa .ana nana nana, 4his sharming man

A jumped%up pqntry b/}
